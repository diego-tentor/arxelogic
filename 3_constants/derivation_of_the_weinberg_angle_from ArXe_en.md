DERIVATION OF THE WEINBERG ANGLE (sin²θ_W)
From Ontological Structure - ArXe Theory
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

1.1 The Constant
Weinberg angle (weak mixing angle):
sin²θ_W(M_Z, MS̄) = 0.23122(4)
θ_W ≈ 28.74°
Physical role:

Determines mixing between electromagnetic and weak neutral current
Relates photon (γ) to Z⁰ boson
Controls ratio m_W/m_Z
Appears in all electroweak processes

Standard Model: sin²θ_W is free parameter, must be measured experimentally.
1.2 Electroweak Unification
Before symmetry breaking:
Gauge group: SU(2)_L × U(1)_Y
Four gauge bosons: W¹, W², W³ (SU(2)) and B⁰ (U(1))
After spontaneous symmetry breaking:
Photon:  |γ⟩  = cos(θ_W)|B⁰⟩ + sin(θ_W)|W³⟩
Z boson: |Z⁰⟩ = -sin(θ_W)|B⁰⟩ + cos(θ_W)|W³⟩
W bosons: W± = (W¹ ∓ iW²)/√2
The Weinberg angle θ_W determines this mixing.
1.3 Mass Relation
sin²θ_W = 1 - (m_W/m_Z)²
Measured:
m_W ≈ 80.4 GeV
m_Z ≈ 91.2 GeV
→ sin²θ_W ≈ 0.223 (on-shell scheme)
or 0.231 (MS̄ scheme at M_Z)
1.4 ArXe Approach
We derive sin²θ_W from:

Source dimensionality: 3D spatial structure (T³)
Field level identification: Weak field at T⁻⁶ (n=13)
Geometric projection: Pure ratio (no π factor)
Master formula: sin²θ_W = d_spatial / n_weak = 3/13

No free parameters. Pure dimensional projection.

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS OF WEAK NEUTRAL CURRENT
================================================================================

2.1 Physical Requirements
The Z⁰ boson has properties:

Massive: m_Z ≈ 91.2 GeV
Neutral (like photon)
Mediates weak neutral current
Short range: λ_Z ~ ℏ/(m_Z c) ~ 10⁻¹⁸ m

Key difference from photon: Z⁰ is MASSIVE.
2.2 Dimensional Structure
Hypothesis: Weak field involves "mass inverse squared"
[Z⁰ field] ~ M⁻²
Physical interpretation:

Related to (m_W² - m_Z²) mass splitting
Weak isospin breaking
Higgs mechanism scale

2.3 Identification with T⁻⁶
From Appendix A.1.3:
T⁻⁶ has dimension M⁻² (inverse mass squared)
n = 13 → e(13) = (-1)¹³ × ⌊13/2⌋ = -6 ✓
Verification:
[T⁻⁶] = (T³)⁻² = M⁻²
Alternative interpretation:
T⁻⁶ = T⁻⁵ × T⁻¹
= (EM flux) × (temporal variation)
= "EM-like flux with additional temporal structure"
Or:
T⁻⁶ = T⁻³ × T⁻³
= (mass variation)²
2.4 Why Not Other Levels?
Dimensional mismatch:
T⁻⁵ = L⁻²·T⁻¹   (EM field) ✗
T⁻⁷ = ?          (too far)  ✗
Only T⁻⁶ = M⁻² matches weak field structure ✓
Conclusion: Weak neutral field level is T⁻⁶ (n=13).

SOURCE LEVEL: 3D SPATIAL STRUCTURE
================================================================================

3.1 Charged Particles in T³
From Appendix A.1.3:
T³ (n=6):

Dimension: M (mass)
Physical meaning: 3D spatial objectivity
Structure: 3 spatial dimensions (x, y, z)

Key property: T³ enables three independent spatial directions.
3.2 Spatial Dimensionality
The weak field couples to particles that exist in 3D space:

Electrons, quarks, neutrinos
All exist in (x, y, z) coordinates
No fourth spatial dimension accessible

Therefore: d_spatial = 3
3.3 Why 3 Specifically?
NOT 4π (like α):
The Weinberg angle is a MIXING PROPORTION, not a coupling strength.
Mixing angles use dimensional counting directly:
sin²θ = (dimension of subspace) / (dimension of total space)
No geometric normalization integral required.
Comparison:
α⁻¹ = 4π × 11    (coupling → needs integral over solid angle)
sin²θ_W = 3/13   (mixing → pure ratio)

ARITY OF WEAK FIELD LEVEL
================================================================================

4.1 From Exentation Mapping
From Appendix A.1.1:
T⁻⁶ corresponds to n = 13
Verification:
e(13) = (-1)¹³ × ⌊13/2⌋ = -1 × 6 = -6 ✓
Inverse:
n(-6) = -2(-6) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 ✓
4.2 Probabilistic Structure
From Appendix A.4.2:
Level n=13:

Arity: 13-ary (13 independent binary variables)
Configuration space: {0,1}¹³ → 2¹³ = 8192 states
Information content: 13 bits
Probability type: Weak field configurations

4.3 Physical Interpretation
The number 13 represents:

Structural distance: From T⁰ to T⁻⁶ traverses 13 levels
Boundary conditions: T⁻⁶ has 6 closed BC pairs + 1 open BC
Total structure: 6×2 + 1 = 13
Configuration complexity: 2¹³ = 8192 possible field configurations
Relation to EM: n_weak = 13 > n_EM = 11

Greater complexity
Weaker coupling (further from T³)



Conclusion: n(T⁻⁶) = 13 is structurally determined.

THE DERIVATION
================================================================================

5.1 Master Formula
From Appendix A.6.1:
For mixing angles:
sin²θ = d_source / n_mixed
Key difference from couplings:

Couplings (α, α_s): use F(d) × n(k) × C
Mixing angles: use d/n (pure ratio)

Reason: Mixing is geometric projection, not interaction strength.
5.2 Component Assembly
Step 1: Source dimensionality
d_spatial = 3
Reason: Physical particles exist in 3D space (T³)
Step 2: Field arity
n_weak = 13
Reason: Weak field is T⁻⁶, with n=13
Step 3: Calculate ratio
sin²θ_W = 3/13
5.3 Numerical Evaluation
sin²θ_W = 3/13
= 0.230769230769...
≈ 0.2308
Observed (MS̄ scheme at M_Z):
sin²θ_W = 0.23122(4)
Agreement:
Error = |0.23122 - 0.23077|/0.23122
= 0.00045/0.23122
= 0.00195
= 0.195%
ERROR: 0.19% ✓✓✓
Even better than α!

PHYSICAL VERIFICATION
================================================================================

6.1 Mass Ratio Prediction
From Standard Model:
sin²θ_W = 1 - (m_W/m_Z)²
Our prediction:
sin²θ_W = 3/13 = 0.2308
Therefore:
(m_W/m_Z)² = 1 - 3/13 = 10/13
m_W/m_Z = √(10/13) = 0.87706...
Measured:
m_W = 80.379(12) GeV
m_Z = 91.1876(21) GeV
m_W/m_Z = 0.88158
Agreement:
Predicted: 0.87706
Observed:  0.88158
Error = 0.00452/0.88158 = 0.51%
Still excellent!
6.2 Running of θ_W
Prediction: θ_W should vary with energy scale (like α).
From Appendix A.5.2:
T⁻⁶ has 1 open BC → scheme dependence → running
Observed running:
At low energy (~m_e):    sin²θ_W ≈ 0.238
At M_Z:                  sin²θ_W ≈ 0.231 → approaching 3/13 = 0.2308
At high energy:          sin²θ_W continues to vary slowly
ArXe interpretation:
The value 3/13 is the "structural attractor" toward which sin²θ_W runs
at high energy.
6.3 Electroweak Unification
At M_GUT ~ 10¹⁶ GeV:
Prediction: α(M_GUT) ≈ α_weak(M_GUT) ≈ α_strong(M_GUT)
ArXe interpretation:
At sufficiently high energy, structural levels merge:

T⁻⁵ (EM) and T⁻⁶ (weak) become indistinguishable
Couplings converge
sin²θ_W approaches fixed value

This is structural unification.

WHY 3/13 SPECIFICALLY?
================================================================================

7.1 Geometric Projection
Physical picture:
In a 13-dimensional probability space (T⁻⁶), we project onto 3-dimensional
physical space (T³).
Projection formula:
sin²θ = |projection|² / |total|²
= dim(subspace) / dim(total)
= 3/13
Analogy:
If you have a vector in 13D space and project it onto a 3D subspace,
the squared length ratio is 3/13.
7.2 Why Not 4π?
Critical distinction:
Type        Formula      Example            Uses π?

Coupling    F(d) × n     α⁻¹ = 4π × 11      Yes
Mixing      d/n          sin²θ_W = 3/13     No
Reason:

Couplings: Require integration over solid angle (∫∫ dΩ = 4π)
Mixings: Pure ratios, no integration needed

Mathematical:
Coupling constant ∝ ∫ (field) × (source) over solid angle → involves 4π
Mixing angle = arcsin(√(dim_sub/dim_total)) → pure ratio
7.3 Connection to Group Theory
SU(2)_L × U(1)_Y structure:
SU(2)_L has:

3 generators (W¹, W², W³)
3D isospin space

U(1)_Y has:

1 generator (B⁰)
1D hypercharge direction

After mixing:
Photon: Linear combination in 1D subspace
Z⁰: Linear combination in remaining directions
Total: 3D spatial projection out of 13D total structure
