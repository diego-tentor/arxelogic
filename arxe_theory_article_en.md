# ArXe Theory: The Logical-Physical Co-emergence of the Universe
## A Cosmology from the Fundamental Contradictory Act

### Introduction

ArXe Theory presents a radical proposal for understanding the fundamental nature of reality: instead of seeking to reduce the physical to the logical-mathematical (as in Platonism) or the logical to the physical (as in physicalism), it establishes a **fundamental kinship** between both domains at their most basic level. This theory does not transfer the ontological mystery to a separate ideal realm, but locates it in the **pure empirical act**, though contradictory and indemonstrable.

The conceptual core of ArXe lies in recognizing that the fundamental question is not "why does something exist instead of nothing?" but "why cannot what exists be the foundation of itself?" This paradoxical circularity drives what we call **excentrations**: movements through which reality attempts to "escape" from its constitutive contradiction, generating increasing levels of complexity that can be read simultaneously as logical developments and physical emergences.

### The Fundamental Axiom

ArXe's axiom establishes: **¬() = Tf = Tp**

This equation arbitrarily relates three elements:
- Logical negation ¬() as the fundamental unit of logical structure
- Fundamental Time (Tf) as the minimum temporal unit with physical meaning
- Planck Time (Tp) as the fundamental physical unit

This is not a **reduction** of one domain to another, but a **kinship** that establishes correspondence between the most basic units of logic and physics. It is like "tying two threads by their ends": an audacious theoretical gesture that allows explaining the universe from the fundamental of both domains simultaneously.

### The Act as Fundamental Contradiction

In ArXe, the fundamental physical act is analogous to logical contradiction. Paraphrasing its nature: *"This precise instant, in its fundamental physical expression, is absolutely actual, is not possible and cannot be verified or demonstrated, does not exist nor is it true"*.

This contradiction is not a problem to be solved but the **generative engine** of all reality. Similar to Dedekind's cut that allows constructing real numbers from a division that does not belong completely to any of the sets it separates, the contradictory act is **not-possible** (therefore actual) and generates the **real line of temporal existence**.

Crucially, this contradiction prevents the existent from being the foundation of itself, avoiding the circular paradox of a reality that would sustain itself without external reference.

### The Structure of Excentrations

From the original contradictory act arise successive **excentrations** that build a hierarchical logical-temporal structure. Each level preserves the logical capacities of the previous ones while developing new dimensions of complexity:

#### **T0 - Absolute Non-existence**
*Logic: Unary*

Absolutely negative time lacks existence and physical expression. It represents pure logical non-existence, prior to any determination. It has no physical meaning nor can be experienced; it constitutes the "degree zero" from which all posterior determination emerges.

#### **T1 - Homogeneous Positive Time** 
*Logic: Unary*

Time that occurs positively with unique direction, but still lacks measurable physical expression. It is a homogeneous temporal field where nothing can be distinguished. It represents pure temporality prior to any variation or differentiation. At this level, temporal experience as we know it does not exist, only **flowing** as such.

**Physical connections**: This level could correspond to the pre-inflationary state of the universe, where temporality exists but without differentiable structure. Vacuum quantum fluctuations would be echoes of the transition from this homogeneous state.

#### **T-1 - Temporal Alterity**
*Logic: Binary, Unary*

Temporal variation emerges: experiential, empirical time as we know it. Temporal phase changes occur, not necessarily regular. Here emerges **alterity** as a principle: the other, the different, variation.

**Physical connections**: 
- The **arrow of time** and thermodynamic irreversibility
- **Irregular variations** in quantum processes
- **Decoherence** as transition from homogeneity (T1) toward variability
- Natural **rhythms** and the emergence of periodicities

#### **T2 - Spatial Anteriority**
*Logic: Binary, Unary*

**Anteriority** emerges (what is before, in front, without implying temporal before/after): spatial simultaneity. Minkowski space is constituted as a great empty and homogeneous field whose evolution is not temporal. Space appears as **contrary** to time: a spatial evolution is not temporal, it is not possible to trace a temporal evolution of empty space.

**Physical connections**:
- The **constancy of c** as a consequence of space-time opposition
- **Special relativity** and the structure of flat space-time
- The emergence of **extension** and **length** as physical concepts
- **Fields** as homogeneous spatial structures

#### **T-2 - Spatial Variation**
*Logic: Binary, Unary*  

**Geodesics** and spatial variations become possible. Regions of different temporal densities and the first relational **'virtual' particles** emerge. Here space-time curvature begins.

**Physical connections**:
- **General relativity** and space-time curvature
- **Virtual particles** as relational effects between different temporal densities
- **Gravitational fields** as variations of the spatial metric
- **Gravitational waves** as propagation of spatial variations
- **Prediction**: There should exist measurable correlation between spatial metric variations and local temporal fluctuations

### Emergence of the Massive Dimension

#### **T3 - Mass as Space-Time**
*Logic: Ternary, Binary, Unary*

Mass emerges as **T2 + T1**: it combines spatiality with positive temporality, corresponding to relativistic space-time. The temporal distinction between **past-present-future** becomes possible. Physics becomes **'Bayesian'** in the sense that probabilistic structure emerges.

**Physical connections**:
- The **Higgs mechanism** as manifestation of the fundamental massive field
- The **distinction** past-present-future emerges only with mass (explaining why massless quantum mechanics is "atemporal")
- **Quantum probability** as an emergent property of this level
- Appearance of **physical particles** as we know them
- The **Higgs Boson** and the universal massive field

**Prediction**: Masses of fundamental particles should follow patterns derivable from the underlying ternary logical structure.

#### **T-3 - Mass Variation**  
*Logic: Ternary, Binary, Unary*

**Massive bodies** and Newtonian physics as a limiting case become possible. Here operate the classical laws of motion and mechanics of extended bodies.

**Physical connections**:
- **Newtonian mechanics** as a limiting regime of stabilized mass variations
- **Astronomical bodies** and orbital dynamics
- **Inertia** as resistance to mass variation
- **Planetary systems** and large-scale structure

### Higher Levels: Hyperspaces and Information Processing

#### **T4 - Computational Hyperspace**
*Logic: Quaternary, Ternary, Binary, Unary*

**Multiple universes** and **natural computers** emerge: black holes, life, and intelligence. **Dark physics** develops as manifestation of hyperspatial properties.

**Physical connections and predictions**:
- **Black holes** as natural processors of information from lower dimensions
- **Life** as a natural phenomenon of informational processing at T4 level
- **Intelligence** emerges naturally from hyperspatial structure
- **Dark matter** as effect of hyperspatial interactions
- **Dark energy** manifesting hyperspatial expansion
- **Prediction**: Black holes would have specific computational capacities calculable according to their mass/size

#### **T5 - Hyper-computers**
*Logic: 5-ary, Quaternary, Ternary, Binary, Unary*

Level of **hyper-computers** and **black hole sinks**. Here would operate information processing processes at cosmic scale.

**Physical connections**:
- **Black hole sinks** connecting with cyclical universe theories
- **Informational processing** at cosmological scale
- Possible **phase transitions** between universes
- **Prediction**: It should be possible to observe signs of informational processing in the largest cosmological structures

### Implications and Experimental Predictions

ArXe Theory generates multiple testable predictions:

1. **Tempo-spatial correlations**: Variations in the spatial metric should correlate with specific temporal fluctuations, especially in intense gravitational fields.

2. **Quantum mass hierarchies**: Masses of fundamental particles should follow mathematical patterns derivable from corresponding n-ary logical structures.

3. **Computational limits of black holes**: Black holes would have predictable and measurable informational processing capacities according to their mass and angular momentum.

4. **Dimensional phase transitions**: Between T levels it should be possible to observe quantized transitions in extreme physical systems (particle colliders, proximity to black holes, etc.).

5. **Dark matter structure**: Dark physics should show patterns related to hyperspatial interactions, particularly in large cosmological structures.

### Conclusion

ArXe Theory offers a cosmology where **the universe is thinking itself** from the beginning. There is no fundamental separation between "logical laws" and "physical laws," but co-emergence from a primordial contradictory act that prevents the existent from being the circular foundation of itself.

This perspective would transform the understanding of phenomena such as consciousness, life, and extreme cosmic processes, not as "additions" posterior to the physical universe, but as **natural developments** of the original logical-physical structure. Quantum physics would cease to be "mysterious" to directly reveal the processual and contradictory character that constitutes the very foundation of reality.

ArXe thus proposes a **processual ontology** where each level preserves and transforms the previous ones, building a cosmos that is simultaneously **logical calculation** and **physical development**, **mathematical structure** and **temporal process**, **contradiction** and **resolution** in perpetual movement.
