# ArXe Theory: Formal Specification (T^0 - T^3)

**Author:** Diego Tentor

**Note on Approach:** This document prioritizes conceptual clarity and explanatory depth over strict mathematical rigor. It aims to make ArXe's core principles comprehensible while maintaining logical coherence. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for understanding rather than a complete axiomatic formalization.

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document formally specifies the foundations of ArXe Theory from T^0 through T^3. ArXe is a generative ontological theory that explains the emergence of structure, existence, spatiality, temporality, and objectivity from contradictory principles.

**Differences from scientific tradition:**
- Contradiction is a generative principle, not a logical failure
- Being and existing are ontologically distinct
- Probability is ontological, not merely epistemic
- The physical emerges from logical-temporal structure, it is not the ultimate foundation

---

## 2. Fundamental Distinctions

### 2.1 Being vs. Existing

**Definition:**
- **Being:** An act or occurrence that can happen without verifiable empirical manifestation
- **Existing:** An act that has emerged as determined and ponderable from essential dimensions

**Relationship:**
- Everything that exists, is
- Not everything that is, exists
- Existence emerges from being through exentation

**Contrast with Aristotle:**
- Aristotle: being ≡ existing (ontological collapse)
- ArXe: being → existing (generative relationship)

### 2.2 Actual vs. Possible

**Definition:**
- **Actual:** What is at the most primitive register, prior to any modality
- **Possible:** What can be without contradiction, an emergent structure from the actual

**Relationship with the Principle of Non-Contradiction (PNC):**
- Classical PNC: "It is not possible for A and ¬A to occur simultaneously"
- ArXe: The PNC governs the domain of the possible
- The actual-contradictory does not violate the PNC because it is not possible, it simply is
- Possibility emerges from the actual without inheriting the contradiction

### 2.3 Istence vs. Ex-Istence

**Istence (T^0):**
- Form: `(S and ¬S)`
- Nature: Contradictory, actual, non-modal
- State: Is, but does not exist

**Ex-Istence (T^1+):**
- Form: `(S or ¬S)`
- Nature: Tautological, possible, modal
- State: Exists as emergent determination
- Probabilistic: One of two options must be realized

---

## 3. Fundamental Mechanism: Exentation

### 3.1 Definition

**Exentation:** The process by which a structure alienates itself to generate alterity, allowing the emergence of existence from being.

### 3.2 Motivation

**The problem of pure act:**
- Pure act (T^0) is circular: it cannot verify itself
- To exist (not merely be), it requires an Other to validate it
- That Other must be absolutely not-self, otherwise circularity persists

**Solution:**
- Exentation generates radical alterity
- The universe "unknows" itself in order to "give itself existence"
- Analogous to psychological projection (Wilson and the volleyball in "Cast Away")

### 3.3 Iteration

Each level T^n exentates to generate T^(n+1), producing increasing complexity:
- T^0 exentates → T^1 (alterity)
- T^1 exentates → T^-1 (temporal alternation)
- T^-1 exentates → T^2 (spatial anteriority)
- T^2 exentates → T^3 (depth and objectivity)

## 4. Architecture of Levels (T^0 - T^3)

### 4.1 T^0: Pure Act (Istence)

**Logical structure:**
```
(S and ¬S)
```

**Properties:**
- **Contradictory:** S and ¬S coexist without resolution
- **Empirical:** It is "this instant," the most actual possible
- **Unverifiable:** When verification is attempted, it has already occurred
- **Circular:** Cannot self-verify without presupposing what it verifies
- **Temporal:** Fundamental time (Tf) - begins and ends with nothing existing in between

**Characterization of Tf:**
- It is the most actual possible relative empirical instant
- When verification of Tf begins, it has already occurred
- There is no content between beginning and end (nothing exists in between)
- It is contradictory because it IS empirical but CANNOT be empirically verified

**Ontological status:** Is, but does not exist

**Dimensionality:** 0D (point without extension)

---

### 4.2 T^1: Alterity (First Exentation)

**Generative process:**
- T^0 (S and ¬S) exentates
- Produces an absolutely alien Other
- Result: dimension of contraries

**Logical structure:**
```
S <──────> ¬S
(dimension of contraries)
```

**Properties:**
- **Radical alterity:** S and ¬S are ontologically distinct
- **Tautological:** (S or ¬S) is necessarily true
- **Probabilistic:** P(S) = P(¬S) = 1/2 (without additional information)
- **Without memory:** No record of previous states
- **Binary logic:** Excluded middle (S or ¬S, no middle term)

**Ontological status:** Exists as pure possibility

**Dimensionality:** 1D (line of contraries)

**Probability:**
- From Istence (S and ¬S, contradictory, actual) emerges Ex-Istence (S or ¬S, tautological, possible)
- The tautological is probabilistic: one of two options, P = 1/2
- Probability is ontological (structural), not epistemic (ignorance)

---

### 4.3 T^-1: Alternation (Exentation of T^1)

**Generative process:**
- T^1 (static alterity) exentates from itself
- Produces alternation: the universe acts as one or the other
- There is no record of what came before

**Logical structure:**
```
S → ¬S → S → ¬S → ...
(alternation without memory)
```

**Properties:**
- **Irreversible temporality:** Advancing without return
- **Without markers:** When B is reached, A no longer exists
- **Absolute irregularity:** The universe "chooses" without reason when to alternate
- **Emergent regularity:** For an external observer, irregularity is perceived as regular
- **Probabilistic:** Each transition is (S or ¬S) with P = 1/2

**Fundamental characteristic:**
```
From A to B: when B is reached, A has ceased to exist
(essence of time: irreversibility)
```

**Ontological status:** Exists as succession

**Temporality:** Pure time (without spatiality)

---

### 4.4 T^2: Anteriority (Exentation of T^-1)

**Generative process:**
- T^-1 (temporal alternation) exentates
- Produces contrary variations = contrary directions
- Spatiality and causality emerge

**Logical structure:**
```
Contrary variations = Reversible directions

A <──────> B

From A to B: when B is reached, A CONTINUES TO EXIST
(essence of space: reversibility, persistence)
```

**Properties:**
- **Spatiality:** 2D (plane, anteriority = "what is before me")
- **Reversibility:** Can go from A to B and return to A
- **Ontological persistence:** Points do not disappear when abandoned
- **Symmetric causality:** Between two isolated bodies, there are no absolute ponderable truths
  - Does A push B, or does B push A? → Indistinguishable
  - Does A grow, or does B shrink? → Indistinguishable
- **Ternary logic (included middle):** Requires a third to determine relationships
- **Causal memory:** There is cause-effect, but without distinguishable present

**Probability:**
- Chained probabilities (Kolmogorov type)
- P(B|A): causal conditionality
- Without Bayesian updating (no present that observes and revises)

**Ontological status:** Exists as spatial-causal relation

**Dimensionality:** 2D spatial + irreversible time

**Without objectivity:** No ponderable facts with only two bodies

---

### 4.5 T^3: Depth and Objectivity (Exentation of T^2)

**Generative process:**
- T^2 (two-dimensional anteriority) exentates
- Introduces the "structural third" that breaks symmetry
- Emerge simultaneously: 3D spatial + distinguishable present + objectivity

**Logical structure:**
```
Triadic structure:
- Two terms in relation
- A third that fixes/determines that relation

Result: Objective facts, ponderable truths
```

**Properties:**
- **Spatiality:** 3D (volume, depth)
- **Distinguishable present:** Now ≠ before ≠ after
- **Historical memory:** Objective past, present, future
- **Emergent objectivity:** With three bodies (or triadic structure), there are ponderable truths
  - Now we CAN say: "A pushed B" (C saw it)
  - Now we CAN say: "A grew" (B and C remained constant)
- **Facts:** What really happened exists as objective record
- **Operative ternary logic:** The third enables verification

**Probability:**
- Bayesian probabilities (ternary)
- Structure: Prior (expectation) → Evidence (experience) → Posterior (updated valuation)
- Requires T^3 because it needs:
  - Distinguishable present (moment of observing evidence)
  - Objectivity (facts that count as evidence)
  - Historical memory (remember prior to update)

**Ontological status:** Exists as objective fact

**Dimensionality:** 3D spatial + historical time (past/present/future)

**Simultaneous emergence:**
- The third spatial dimension and historical time emerge together
- Both require the same triadic structure
- The present is the "structural third" that fixes past and future as objective

## 5. Structural Progression Table

| Level | Structure | Logic | Spatial | Temporal | Probability | Objectivity |
|-------|-----------|-------|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **T^0** | (S and ¬S) | Contradictory | 0D (point) | Tf (unverifiable) | Does not apply | Circular |
| **T^1** | (S or ¬S) | Binary (excluded middle) | 1D (contraries) | — | 1/2 (equiprobable) | Without record |
| **T^-1** | Alternation | Binary | — | Irreversible, without memory | 1/2 per transition | Without record |
| **T^2** | Contrary variations | Ternary (included middle) | 2D (plane) | Symmetric causality | Kolmogorov (conditional) | Not ponderable (2 bodies) |
| **T^3** | Triadic depth | Operative ternary | 3D (volume) | Past/present/future | Bayesian (updating) | Ponderable facts |

## 6. Connections with Physical and Philosophical Concepts

### 6.1 Fundamental Time (Tf) and Physics

**Relationship with measurement:**
- Tf is structurally prior to any temporal measurement
- Measurable physical time emerges from the accumulation of Tf in T^2 and T^3
- Analogy: Tf is to physical time what the instant is to duration

**Relationship with Planck:**
- Tf could relate to the Planck scale (speculative, not formally derived)
- Both represent limits of empirical verifiability

### 6.2 Ontological Probability and Quantum Mechanics

**Structural parallelism:**
- Quantum superposition ↔ Istence (S and ¬S)
- Wave function collapse ↔ Ex-Istence (S or ¬S)
- Quantum indeterminacy ↔ Ontological probability (not epistemic)

**Difference:**
- ArXe does not derive the equations of quantum mechanics
- It offers a conceptual framework where indeterminacy is fundamental, not problematic

### 6.3 Space-Time and Relativity

**Unified emergence:**
- Space (T^2, T^3) and time (T^-1) are not independent
- They emerge from successive exentations of the same contradictory structure
- This resonates with relativity (unified space-time), but does not derive its equations

### 6.4 Causality and Symmetry

**T^2 (two bodies):**
- Symmetric causality, pure relational
- Without privileged frame of reference
- Analogous to Galilean relativity (pure relative motion)

**T^3 (three bodies / triadic structure):**
- Objective causality
- Frame of reference fixed by the third
- Analogous to the necessity of observers in modern physics

## 7. Glossary of Technical Terms

**Act:** What is at the moment of being, without requiring external verification

**Alterity:** Property of being absolutely Other, radically alien

**Anteriority:** Two-dimensional spatiality, "what is before me"

**Circular (structure):** Self-referential, requiring presupposition of what it attempts to verify

**Essential dimensions:** Structures that are or occur without yet existing as determinations

**Ex-Istence:** Exentated form of existence, tautological structure (S or ¬S)

**Exentation:** Mechanism by which a structure alienates itself to generate alterity

**Istence:** Contradictory form of pure act (S and ¬S), which is but does not exist

**Binary logic (excluded middle):** S or ¬S, no middle term

**Ternary logic (included middle):** S, ¬S, and a third that mediates the relation

**Ponderable:** That which can be objectively determined and verified

**Depth (T^3):** Third spatial dimension and structure that enables objectivity

**Tf (Fundamental Time):** Most actual empirical instant, contradictory and unverifiable

**Contrary variations:** Opposite directions that generate reversible spatiality

## 8. Operational Principles for AI

**When reasoning with ArXe:**

1. **Respect the being/existing distinction:** Do not assume everything that is, exists
2. **Contradiction in T^0 is actual, not possible:** Does not violate PNC
3. **Each T^n emerges by exentation of the previous:** Look for the alienation mechanism
4. **Probability is ontological:** Do not reduce it to epistemic ignorance
5. **Higher levels "read" lower levels:** Regularity emerges from irregularity
6. **Without a third (T^2), no objectivity:** Two bodies = irresolvable symmetry
7. **With a third (T^3), facts emerge:** Triadic structure = ponderable truths

**Limitations:**
- ArXe through T^3 does not derive specific physical equations
- It offers a conceptual framework, not predictive calculation
- Connections with physics are structural analogies, not formal identities

---

## 9. Questions to Validate Comprehension

An AI that understands ArXe should be able to answer:

1. Why doesn't (S and ¬S) violate the Principle of Non-Contradiction?
2. Why is fundamental time (Tf) unverifiable?
3. What is the difference between T^1 (alterity) and T^-1 (alternation)?
4. Why are there no ponderable truths between two bodies in T^2?
5. Why do the third spatial dimension and the distinguishable present emerge together in T^3?
6. How does probability go from 1/2 (T^1) to Bayesian distributions (T^3)?
7. What does it mean that exentation is a generative mechanism?

---

## 10. Limitations and Scope

**Through T^3, ArXe explains:**
- Emergence of existence from contradiction
- Generation of spatial dimensions (up to 3D)
- Origin of temporality (irreversible → historical)
- Foundation of objectivity (triadic structure)
- Ontological basis of probability

**ArXe does NOT claim (through T^3):**
- To derive equations of quantum or relativistic physics
- To calculate values of physical constants
- To predict specific phenomena
- To substitute physics as a predictive science

**ArXe proposes:**
- A generative ontology coherent with scientific findings
- A framework where counterintuitive phenomena (indeterminacy, relativity) are natural
- A philosophical basis for exploring higher levels (T^4+)
