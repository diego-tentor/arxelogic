# ArXe Theory: The Logical-Physical Co-emergence of the Universe
## A Cosmology from the Fundamental Contradictory Act

## 1. Purpose and Scope
This document formally specifies the foundations of ArXe Theory from T^0 to T^3. ArXe is a generative ontological theory that explains the emergence of structure, existence, spatiality, temporality and objectivity from contradictory principles.
It does not claim or achieve mathematical rigor, focusing on the understanding of the system of ideas being transmitted.
ArXe compares its a priori results with phenomena demonstrated by science and even some speculative ones as a form of self-validation and not as competition in the field of knowledge.

### Introduction

ArXe Theory presents a radical proposal for understanding the fundamental nature of reality: instead of seeking to reduce the physical to the logical-mathematical (as in Platonism) or the logical to the physical (as in physicalism), it establishes a **fundamental kinship** between both domains at their most basic level. This theory does not transfer the ontological mystery to a separate ideal realm, but locates it in the **pure empirical act**, albeit contradictory and unprovable.

The conceptual core of ArXe lies in recognizing that the fundamental question is not "why does something exist instead of nothing?" but "why can what exists not be the foundation of itself?" This paradoxical circularity drives what we call **exentations**: movements through which reality tries to "escape" from its constitutive contradiction, generating levels of increasing complexity that can be read simultaneously as logical developments and physical emergences.

### 4. Axiom
** ArXe Theory proposes a single axiom of its own
** Axiom: ¬() ≜ Tf ⋍ 1Tp

### The Fundamental Axiom
The ArXe axiom establishes:  
**¬() ≜ Tf ⋍ Tp**  
where:

- **¬()** denotes logical negation (the primitive act of distinction), consistent with classical negation properties.
- **Tf** denotes *conceptual fundamental time*, the minimal unit of temporal possibility.
- **Tp** denotes *physical fundamental time*, identified with Planck time (≈ 5.39 × 10⁻⁴⁴ s).

This triple relation links:
1. **Logical structure** (¬()) as the fundamental unit of distinction.
2. **Conceptual time** (Tf) as the minimal frame for actualization.
3. **Physical time** (Tp) as the empirical lower bound, proposed here as a correspondence.

The symbol `≜` indicates conceptual equivalence (logical-physical kinship), while `⋍` denotes a postulated correspondence with Planck scale, not a derived identity.

It is not a **reduction** of one domain to the other, but a **kinship** that establishes correspondence between the most basic units of logic and physics. It's like "tying two threads at their ends": a bold theoretical gesture that allows explaining the universe from the fundamentals of both domains simultaneously.

### Intuitive Justification  

The axiom can be understood through two complementary images:

1. **The marble-and-hole analogy**  
   In a fundamental temporal “hole” (Tf), only one elementary act of distinction (¬()) can occur — just as only one marble fits in a single hole. This reflects the indivisibility of the primitive logical-physical unit.

2. **Tying threads at their ends**  
   Rather than reducing logic to physics or vice versa, ArXe “ties” them at their most basic ends:  
   - The logical end: negation (¬()) as the minimal act of distinction.  
   - The physical end: fundamental time (Tf) as the minimal unit of change.  
   This knot (¬() ≜ Tf) establishes a **generative kinship**, not a reduction.

These analogies highlight a key departure from classical physics:  
while classical physics treats time and space as given, ArXe **derives** temporal and spatial structures from a single contradictory act, ensuring a necessary correspondence between logical “marbles” and physical “holes” from the outset.

### The Act as Fundamental Contradiction

In ArXe, the fundamental physical act is analogous to logical contradiction. Paraphrasing its nature: *"This precise instant, in its fundamental physical expression, is absolutely actual, it is not possible and cannot be verified or demonstrated, it does not exist nor is it true"*.

This contradiction is not a problem to solve but the **generative engine** of all reality. Similar to Dedekind's cut that allows constructing real numbers from a division that does not completely belong to any of the sets it separates, the contradictory act is **non-possible** (therefore actual) and generates the **real line of temporal existence**.

Crucially, this contradiction prevents what exists from being the foundation of itself, avoiding the circular paradox of a reality that would sustain itself without external reference.

# 5. Recursive Fractal Ontology and Dimensional Mapping
## Recursive Exentation System
### Definition
**Entification** (conjunction):
```
Entₙ := Entₙ₋₁ ∧ ExEntₙ₋₁
```
**Exentation** (negation → disjunction):
```
ExEntₙ := ¬(Entₙ₋₁ ∧ ExEntₙ₋₁) ≡ ¬Entₙ₋₁ ∨ ¬ExEntₙ₋₁
```
**Initial condition**:
```
Ent₁ := S ∧ ¬S
ExEnt₁ := S ∨ ¬S
```

### 5.2 Logical Structure
Each level of exentation exposes an n-ary logical structure
** Examples
- e(1) = Unary logic: contradictories, false, negative
- e(2) = Binary logic: excluded middle, non-contradictory contraries, (t) true and (f) false, (b) beginning and (e) end, pair, both, non-objective distinction, phases
- e(3) = Ternary logic: modality, included middle, "observer", third to the pair, mediator, participant, objective distinction
- e(4) = 4-ary logic: pairs of contraries, opposition, polarity
- e (n) = n-ary logic.

** Phases
- The exentation number determines the number of phases; at its level each phase is isomorphic
- The phenomenological totality is the superposition of levels

### 5.2 Recursive Structure

Each level n generates two complementary elements through con-junction (represented by the logical AND operator) and dis-junction (represented by the XOR operator), creating an infinite self-similar hierarchy.

## 5.3 Mapping Function e(n) → k

### 5.4 Definition

```
e(n) = {
  0                    if n = 1
  (-1)ⁿ · ⌊n/2⌋        if n > 1
}
```

### 5.5 Generated Sequence

| n | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **e(n)** | **0** | **1** | **-1** | **2** | **-2** | **3** | **-3** | **4** | **-4** |

**Pattern**: {0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, ...}

**Property**: The function maps ℕ → ℤ surjectively, alternating positive (n even) and negative (n odd) exponents.

---

## 5.6 Inverse Function n(k) ← k

### 5.7 Derivation

To invert e(n) = k:

- **k = 0**: Only n = 1 satisfies e(1) = 0
- **k > 0**: Occurs when n is even, then k = n/2 → **n = 2k**
- **k < 0**: Occurs when n is odd, then k = -(n-1)/2 → **n = -2k + 1**

### 5.8 Inverse Formula

```
n(k) = {
  1           if k = 0
  2k          if k > 0
  -2k + 1     if k < 0
}
```

### 5.9 Verification

- n(0) = 1, e(1) = 0 ✓
- n(2) = 4, e(4) = 2 ✓  
- n(-2) = 5, e(5) = -2 ✓

**Theorem**: e and n establish a bijection between ℕ and ℤ.

---

### Consequences

1. Each logical transition (n → n+1) corresponds to an exponential transition
2. The recursive structure isomorphizes with an exponential structure
3. The system has a singular zero point (T⁰) and two branches (k > 0, k < 0)

---

## 6. Dimensional Assignment

### 6.1 Hypothesis

- Each exponent indicates a pair of contraries and existents, as typical example: beginning and end
- T (Time) "finite unit (that has beginning and end), existent, tautological"
- It is deduced that a thing and its contrary are possible if they do not occur in the same Tf

** T^n = ArXe existent Time
- It is distinguished from Tf in that T^1 equals 2*Tf
- According to PNC, if something and its contrary are not possible in 1Tf, it is possible in 2TF = T^1 = T (physical)

```
T¹ ≡ T    (analogous to physical Time)
T² ≡ L    (analogous to physical Length)
T³ ≡ M    (analogous to physical Mass)
```

- T^1 can be interpreted as an analog of Time or one-dimensional physical space insofar as possible, real, existent and true units.
- T^2 can be interpreted:
  - as an analog of Length or two-dimensional space, insofar as it extends from one T^1 point to another T^1, or from an initial moment to a final moment
  - as a double temporal sense, one and an inverse
  - as double finitude: existing starting point and existing ending point
- T^3 can be interpreted:
  - as an analog of three-dimensional space following the previous reasoning
  - as unification of space and time

### 6.2 Ontological Isomorphisms Table
* Following the previous analogies and inferring new ones

| n | k | Tᵏ | Dimension | Interpretation |
|---|---|-------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | 0 | T⁰ | 1 | Dimensionless |
| 2 | 1 | T¹ | **T** | Time |
| 3 | -1 | T⁻¹ | 1/T | Frequency |
| 4 | 2 | T² | **L** | Length |
| 5 | -2 | T⁻² | 1/L² | Curvature |
| 6 | 3 | T³ | **M** | Mass |
| 7 | -3 | T⁻³ | 1/M³ | Inverse density |

### 6.3 Observations

- **Positive exponents**: Direct dimensions (T, L, M)
- **Negative exponents**: Inverse dimensions (1/T, 1/L², 1/M³)
- Compatible with standard dimensional analysis

---

## 6.4 Algebraic Structure

### 6.5 Exponent Group

The exponents {Tᵏ : k ∈ ℤ} form an abelian group:

```
Tᵏ · Tᵐ = Tᵏ⁺ᵐ
(Tᵏ)⁻¹ = T⁻ᵏ
T⁰ = identity
```

Isomorphic to (ℤ, +).

### 6.6 Duality

The system exhibits multiple dualities:
- **Logical**: Conjunction (∧) ↔ Disjunction (∨)
- **Exponential**: k ↔ -k
- **Dimensional**: Direct ↔ Inverse
- **Parity**: Even (k > 0) ↔ Odd (k < 0)

---

### The Structure of Exentations

From the original contradictory act arise successive **exentations** that build a hierarchical logical-temporal structure. Each level preserves the logical capacities of previous ones while developing new dimensions of complexity:

#### **T^0 - Absolute Non-existence**
*Logic: Unary.

Absolutely negative time lacks existence and physical expression. It represents pure logical non-existence, prior to any determination. It has no physical meaning and cannot be experienced; it constitutes the "zero degree" from which all subsequent determination emerges.

#### **T^1 - Homogeneous Positive Time** 
*Logic: Binary.

Time that occurs positively with a single direction, but still lacks measurable physical expression. It is a homogeneous temporal field where nothing can be distinguished. It represents pure temporality prior to any variation or differentiation. At this level, temporal experience as we know it does not exist, only **flow** as such.

**Physical similarities**: This level could correspond to the pre-inflationary state of the universe, where temporality exists but without differentiable structure. Quantum vacuum fluctuations would be echoes of the transition from this homogeneous state.

#### **T^-1 - Temporal Alterity**
*Logic: Ternary.

The variation of time arises: experienceable, empirical time as we know it. Temporal phase changes occur, not necessarily regular. Here **alterity** emerges as a principle: the other, the different, the variation.

**Physical similarities**: 
- The **arrow of time** and thermodynamic irreversibility
- **Irregular variations** in quantum processes
- **Decoherence** as a transition from homogeneity (T1) towards variability
- Natural **rhythms** and the emergence of periodicities

#### **T^2 - Spatial Anteriority**
*Logic: 4-ary.

**Anteriority** emerges (what is before, in front, without implying temporality of before/after): spatial simultaneity. Minkowski space is constituted as a great empty and homogeneous field whose evolution is not temporal. Space appears as **contrary** to time: a spatial evolution is not temporal, it is not possible to trace a temporal evolution of empty space.

**Physical similarities**:
- The **constancy of c** as a consequence of space-time opposition
- **Special relativity** and the structure of flat spacetime
- The emergence of **extension** and **length** as physical concepts
- **Fields** as homogeneous spatial structures

#### **T^-2 - Spatial Variation**
*Logic: 5-ary.

**Geodesics** and variations of space become possible. Regions of different temporal densities and the first 'virtual' **particles** of relational character emerge. Here begins the curvature of spacetime.

**Physical similarities**:
- **General relativity** and spacetime curvature
- **Virtual particles** as relational effects between different temporal densities
- **Gravitational fields** as variations of the spatial metric
- **Gravitational waves** as propagation of spatial variations
- **Prediction**: There should exist measurable correlation between spatial metric variations and local temporal fluctuations

### Emergence of the Massive Dimension

#### **T^3 - Mass as Space-Time**
*Logic: 6-ary.

Mass arises as **T2 + T1**: it combines spatiality with positive temporality, corresponding to relativistic spacetime. Temporal distinction between **past-present-future** becomes possible. Physics becomes **'Bayesian'** in the sense that probabilistic structure emerges.

**Physical similarities**:
- The **Higgs mechanism** as manifestation of the fundamental massive field
- The **distinction** past-present-future emerges only with mass (explaining why massless quantum mechanics is "atemporal")
- **Quantum probability** as an emergent property of this level
- Appearance of **physical particles** as we know them
- The **Higgs Boson** and the universal massive field

**Prediction**: Fundamental particle masses should follow patterns derivable from the underlying ternary logical structure.

#### **T^-3 - Massive Variation / Color structure (3 colors, confinement)**  
*Logic: 7-ary.

**Massive bodies** and Newtonian physics as a limiting case become possible. Here operate the classical laws of motion and mechanics of extended bodies.

**Physical similarities**:
- **Newtonian mechanics** as limiting regime of stabilized mass variations
- **Astronomical bodies** and orbital dynamics
- **Inertia** as resistance to massive variation
- **Planetary systems** and large-scale structure

### 4.3 T^-1: Alternation (Exentation of T^1)

**Generative process:**
- T^1 (static alterity) exents from itself
- Produces alternation: the universe acts as one or as the other
- No record of what came before

**Logical structure:**
```
S → ¬S → S → ¬S → ...
(alternation without memory)
```

**Properties:**
- **Irreversible temporal:** Advancing without return
- **Without milestones:** When B is reached, A no longer exists
- **Absolute irregularity:** The universe "chooses" without reason when to alternate
- **Emergent regularity:** For an external observer, irregularity is perceived as regular
- **Probabilistic:** Each transition is (S or ¬S) with P = 1/2

**Fundamental characteristic:**
```
From A to B: when B is reached, A has ceased to exist
(essence of time: irreversibility)
```

**Ontological state:** Exists as succession

**Temporality:** Pure time (without spatiality)

---

### 4.4 T^2: Anteriority (Exentation of T^-1)

**Generative process:**
- T^-1 (temporal alternation) exents
- Produces contrary variations = contrary directions
- Spatiality and causality emerge

**Logical structure:**
```
Contrary variations = Reversible directions

A <──────> B

From A to B: when B is reached, A CONTINUES TO EXIST
(essence of space: reversibility, persistence)
```

**Properties:**
- **Spatiality:** 2D (plane, anteriority = "what is before me")
- **Reversibility:** I can go from A to B and return to A
- **Ontological persistence:** Points do not disappear when abandoned
- **Symmetric causality:** Between two isolated bodies, there are no absolute ponderable truths
  - Does A push B, or does B push A? → Indistinguishable
  - Does A enlarge, or does B shrink? → Indistinguishable
- **Ternary logic (included middle):** Requires a third to determine relationships
- **Causal memory:** There is cause-effect, but without distinguishable present

**Probability:**
- Chained probabilities (Kolmogorov type)
- P(B|A): causal conditionality
- Without Bayesian updating (no present that observes and revises)

**Ontological state:** Exists as spatial-causal relation

**Dimensionality:** 2D spatial + irreversible time

**Without objectivity:** There are no ponderable facts with two bodies only

---

### 4.5 T^3: Depth and Objectivity (Exentation of T^2)

**Generative process:**
- T^2 (two-dimensional anteriority) exents
- Introduces the "structural third" that breaks symmetry
- Simultaneously emerge: 3D spatial + distinguishable present + objectivity

**Logical structure:**
```
Triadic structure:
- Two terms in relation
- A third that fixes/determines that relation

Result: Objective facts, ponderable truths
```

**Properties:**
- **Spatiality:** 3D (volume, depth)
- **Distinguishable present:** Now ≠ before ≠ after
- **Historical memory:** Objective past, present, future
- **Emergent objectivity:** With three bodies (or triadic structure), there are ponderable truths
  - NOW we CAN say: "A pushed B" (C saw it)
  - NOW we CAN say: "A enlarged" (B and C remained constant)
- **Facts:** What really happened exists as objective record
- **Operative ternary logic:** The third allows verification

**Probability:**
- Pi probabilistic (Buffon problem)
- Bayesian probabilities (ternary)
- Structure: Prior (expectation) → Evidence (experience) → Posterior (valuation)
- Requires T^3 because it needs:
  - Distinguishable present (moment to observe evidence)
  - Objectivity (facts that count as evidence)
  - Historical memory (remember prior to update)

**Ontological state:** Exists as objective fact

**Dimensionality:** 3D spatial + historical time (past/present/future)

**Simultaneous emergence:**
- The third spatial dimension and historical time emerge together
- Both require the same triadic structure
- The present is the "structural third" that fixes past and future as objective

## 6. Structural Progression Table

| Level | Structure | Logic | Spatial | Temporal | Probability | Objectivity |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **T^0** | (S and ¬S) | Contradictory | 0D (point) | Tf (unverifiable) | Does not apply | Circular |
| **T^1** | (S or ¬S) | Binary (excluded middle) | 1D (contraries) | — | 1/2 (equiprobable) | Without record |
| **T^-1** | Alternation | 3-ary (included middle) | — | Irreversible, without memory | 1/2 per transition | Without record |
| **T^2** | Contrary variations | 4-ary | 2D (plane) | Symmetric causality | Kolmogorov (conditional) | Not ponderable (2 bodies) |
| **T^3** | Triadic depth | 6-ary | 3D (volume) | Past/present/future | Pi Probabilistic | Bayesian (updating) | Ponderable facts |

### Higher Levels: Hyperspaces and Information Processing

#### **T4 - Computational Hyperspace**
*Logic: 8-ary.

**Multiple universes** and **natural computers** emerge: black holes, life and intelligence. **Dark physics** develops as manifestation of hyperspatial properties.

**Physical connections and predictions**:
- **Black holes** as natural processors of information from lower dimensions
- **Life** as natural phenomenon of informational processing at T4 level
- **Intelligence** emerges naturally from hyperspatial structure
- **Dark matter** as effect of hyperspatial interactions
- **Dark energy** manifesting hyperspatial expansion
- **Prediction**: Black holes would have specific computable computational capacities according to their mass/size

#### **T5 - Hyper-computers**
*Logic: 10-ary.

Level of **hyper-computers** and **black hole sinks**. Here would operate information processing processes at cosmic scale.

**Physical connections**:
- **Black hole sinks** connecting with cyclic universe theories
- **Informational processing** at cosmological scale
- Possible **phase transitions** between universes
- **Prediction**: It should be possible to observe signs of informational processing in the largest cosmological structures

## 7. Similarities with Physical and Philosophical Concepts

### 7.1 Fundamental Time (Tf) and Physics

**Relation with measurement:**
- Tf is structurally prior to any temporal measurement
- Measurable physical time emerges from the accumulation of Tf in T^2 and T^3
- Analogy: Tf is to physical time what the instant is to duration

**Relation with Planck:**
- Tf could relate to Planck scale (speculative, not formally derived)
- Both represent limits of empirical verifiability

### 7.2 Ontological Probability and Quantum Mechanics

**Structural parallelism:**
- Quantum superposition ↔ Istence (S and ¬S)
- Wave function collapse ↔ Ex-Istence (S or ¬S)
- Quantum indeterminacy ↔ Ontological probability (not epistemic)

**Difference:**
- Offers a conceptual framework where indeterminacy is fundamental, not problematic

### 7.3 Space-Time and Relativity

**Unified emergence:**
- Space (T^2, T^3) and time (T^-1) are not independent
- Emerge from successive exentations of the same contradictory structure
- This resonates with relativity (unified spacetime), but does not derive its equations

### 7.4 Causality and Symmetry

**T^2 (two bodies):**
- Symmetric causality, pure relational
- Without privileged reference frame
- Analogous to Galilean relativity (pure relative motion)

**T^3 (three bodies / triadic structure):**
- Objective causality
- Reference frame fixed by the third
- Analogous to the necessity of observers in modern physics

## 8. Glossary of Technical Terms

**Act:** What is at the moment of being, without requiring external verification
**Alterity:** Property of being absolute Other, radically foreign
**Anteriority:** Two-dimensional spatiality, "what is before me"
**Circular (structure):** Self-referential, requiring presupposition of what it attempts to verify
**Essential dimensions:** Structures that are or occur without yet existing as determinations
**Ex-Istence:** Exented form of existence, tautological structure (S or ¬S)
**Exentation:** Mechanism by which a structure alienates itself to generate alterity, disambiguation mechanism
**Istence:** Contradictory form of pure act (S and ¬S), which is but does not exist, terminological wink of "This", "Being" to conclude that "Ex-Istence" is the "ex this" or what "was this"
**Binary logic (excluded middle):** S or ¬S, without middle term
**Ternary logic (included middle):** S, ¬S, and a third that mediates the relation
**Ponderable:** That can be objectively determined and verified
**Depth (T^3):** Third spatial dimension and structure that allows objectivity
**Tf (Fundamental time):** Most actual empirical instant, contradictory and unverifiable
**Contrary variations:** Opposite directions that generate reversible spatiality

## 9. Operational Principles for AI

**When reasoning with ArXe:**

1. **Respect the being/existing distinction:** Do not assume that everything that is, exists
2. **The contradiction in T^0 is actual, not possible:** Does not violate PNC
3. **Each T^n emerges by exentation of the previous:** Look for the alienation mechanism
4. **Probability is ontological:** Do not reduce it to epistemic ignorance
5. **Higher levels "read" lower levels:** Regularity emerges from irregularity
6. **Without third (T^2), no objectivity:** Two bodies = unresolvable symmetry
7. **With third (T^3), facts emerge:** Triadic structure = ponderable truths

---

## 10. Limitations and Scope

**Up to T^3, ArXe explains:**
- Emergence of existence from contradiction
- Generation of spatial dimensions (up to 3D)
- Origin of temporality (irreversible → historical)
- Foundation of objectivity (triadic structure)
- Ontological basis of probability

**ArXe proposes:**
- A generative ontology coherent with scientific findings
- A framework where counterintuitive phenomena (indeterminacy, relativity) are natural
- A philosophical basis to explore higher levels (T^4+)

## 5. Key Observations

### Coherence with MLT System

The system **T¹=T, T²=L, T³=M** exactly reproduces the **MLT system** (Mass-Length-Time) of classical dimensional analysis:

✅ All mechanical magnitudes are expressible  
✅ Negative exponents generate rates, densities and variations  
✅ The structure is consistent with standard dimensional physics  
✅ Combinations produce all derived SI units  

### Pattern of Negative Exponents

- **k = -1**: Temporal variation (how many times per second?)
- **k = -2**: Linear/surface spatial variation (how much per meter/meter²?)
- **k = -3**: Massive variation (how much per kilogram?) / Color structure (3 colors, confinement)
- **k = -5**: Volumetric spatial variation (how much per meter³?)

### Fundamental Duality

Each positive exponent has its negative "dual":
- **T¹ (time) ↔ T⁻¹ (frequency)**
- **T² (length) ↔ T⁻² (curvature)**
- **T³ (mass) ↔ T⁻³ (per unit mass)**

### Experimental Implications and Predictions

ArXe Theory generates multiple testable predictions:

1. **Tempo-spatial correlations**: Variations in spatial metric should correlate with specific temporal fluctuations, especially in intense gravitational fields.
2. **Quantum mass hierarchies**: Fundamental particle masses should follow mathematical patterns derivable from corresponding n-ary logical structures.
3. **Computational limits of black holes**: Black holes would have predictable and measurable information processing capacities according to their mass and angular momentum.
4. **Dimensional phase transitions**: Between T levels it should be possible to observe quantized transitions in extreme physical systems (particle colliders, proximity to black holes, etc.).
5. **Dark matter structure**: Dark physics should show patterns related to hyperspatial interactions, particularly in large cosmological structures.
