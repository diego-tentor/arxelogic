# n-ary Logics: Ontological and Phenomenological Foundations

## 🌟 Preliminary Note
*This document explores the phenomenological and ontological foundations of n-ary logical structures, focusing on temporal experience and the emergence of space.*

## 🔄 Fundamental Structures by Arity Level

### 1. Unary Logic (1-ary) - Level T⁰

**Central Characteristics:**
- **Fundamental tautology**: (S ∨ ¬S)
- **Pure logical contingency**
- **Absence of**: probabilities, finitude/infinitude, relations
- **Single operator**: Negation
- **Fact**: Fundamental act without distinctions

**Temporal Nature:**
- 1 temporal particle (Tf)
- Pre-modal contradictory state
- Pure ontological present

---

### 2. Binary Logic (2-ary) - Level T¹

**Basic Structure:**
- 2 isomorphic existences: (s, s') ≡ (s', s)
- Logic of non-contradictory opposites
- 1 closed boundary condition

**Key Concepts:**

#### 🔁 Alterity
The existence of "the other" as constitutive
(a, a') = (a', a) → (one, other) = (other, one)

text

#### 🚫 Excluded Third
- Non-observable relations between (a, a')
- No structure for external participation
- Unextended finite relations

#### ⚡ Immediacy
- No mediation between a and a'
- Direct and unextended relation

#### 🔄 Mutuality
- **Fundamental undecidability**: Any directional attribution is undecidable
- **Examples**:
  - Attraction: A → B vs B → A → Mutual attraction
  - Containment: A ⊂ B vs B ⊂ A → Mutual containment
- **Conclusion**: The relation is always "both"

**Emergent Properties:**
- Boolean logic with (s ⊕ ¬s)
- Without proper order (paradoxical)
- Equiprobabilities: P(a) = P(a') = 1/2
- 2 temporal particles (Tf)

---

### 3. Ternary Logic (3-ary) - Level T⁻¹

**Structure:**
- 3 isomorphic existences or 2 dimorphic existences
- 3 simultaneous undecidable pairs

**Fundamental Mechanisms:**

#### 🎭 Variance
- Capacity to act as one or as the other
- ((a, a') a'') → (a (a', a''))

#### 🔄 Alternation
((a, a') a'') → (a (a', a''))

text

#### 👁️ Third Participant
- Ambiguous participation: inclusion/exclusion
- ((a, a') a'') = ((a', a) a'') = ((a', a'') a) = ...

**Roles of the Third:**
- Mediating (not part)
- Realm of "both"
- Disambiguator
- Enables empirical mediation

**Emergent Properties:**
- Medium or Mediation between opposites
- 2 directions (1 inverse)
- Proper order: (a,b) ≠ (b,a)
- Extensive time
- 3 temporal particles (Tf)

---

### 4. Quaternary Logic (4-ary) - Level T²

**Emergent Characteristics:**
- **Spatial simultaneity**
- Absence of temporal order
- **Orbitality** and symmetry
- Non-decidable mutuality
- Unextended 2D space (X,Y)

**Spatial Mechanisms:**

#### 🌌 Containence
(a (a', a'') a''')

text

#### 📐 Parallax
(a a'), (a'', a''')

text

#### ⚡ Pansion
- Impansion/expansion as fundamental dynamic
- (a (a', a'') a''')

**Structure:**
- 2 simultaneous existing finitudes
- 2 determinable boundary conditions
- 4 temporal particles (Tf)

## 🕰️ Quantized Temporal Phenomenology

### Temporal Particles (Tf) - Formal Definition

**Fundamental Properties:**
1. **Indivisibility**: No "half Tf" or "quarter Tf" exists
2. **Isomorphism**: Every Tf is identical to any other Tf
3. **Contradiction**: Each Tf IS the present but CANNOT be captured as present
4. **Empirical Inaccessibility**: Cannot be directly measured

### Temporal Structure Table

| Level | Tf | Structure | Ontological Status |
|-------|----|-----------|-------------------|
| **T⁰** | 1 | Contradictory | Pure |
| **T¹** | 2 | (a, a') symmetric | Without object |
| **T⁻¹** | 3 | Asymmetric A=1Tf, B=2Tf | + Objective |
| **T²** | 4 | (2Tf, 2Tf) symmetric | Spatial |
| **T³** | 6 | Triadic | Stable objective |

## 🎪 Key Emergent Phenomena

### 1. Perceived Regularity 🎵
Real sequence: 000011000000111000000000000011111...
Experience: 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1...

Mechanism: Mind doesn't distinguish individual Tfs
→ Every variation is experienced as regular
→ Independent of actual frequency

text

### 2. Emergence of Space 🌌
Premise: 2 identical existences
Problem: No objective criterion to order them
Solution: Forced simultaneity
Result: Space as "contradict of time"

text

### 3. Dimensional Ambiguity 📍
In T⁻¹ (3-arity):
"Middle" can mean:

BETWEEN (start and end) → Linear dimensionality

SURROUNDS or is OUTSIDE → Radial dimensionality

This ambiguity founds the possibility of multiple dimensions

## 💡 Fundamental Principles

### Limits of Experience
- Impossible to experience the current n-ary level
- Only the (n-1)-ary level is experienced
- **Corollary**: We cannot experience ourselves directly
- **Crucial**: Distinguish between "experience" and "empiricism"

### Structural Progression
T⁰: 1 Tf → Contradictory unity
T¹: 2 Tf → First symmetric pair
T⁻¹: 3 Tf → First asymmetric (experience)
T²: 4 Tf → Pair of pairs (space)
T³: 6 Tf → Triadic (objectivity)

text

### Philosophical Implications
- **Time**: Ordered succession of indistinguishable phases
- **Space**: Simultaneity forced by indistinguishability
- **Consciousness**: Capacity to experience lower levels
- **Reality**: Self-organizing n-ary structure

---

## 🎯 Key Conclusions

1. **Temporal particles (Tf) are the ontological primitives**
2. **Experience emerges from structural asymmetry**  
3. **Space arises from order indistinguishability**
4. **Perceived regularity is a phenomenal illusion**
5. **Each n-ary level enables qualitatively different experiences**
