# Proof: All Knowledge Systems Require Undemonstrable Axioms

## Definitions

Let a knowledge system \(K\) be an ordered pair:

\[
K = \langle A, R \rangle
\]

where:

- \(A = \{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_m\}\) is a set of axioms.
- \(R\) is a set of inference rules.

A proposition \(P \in K\) is derivable if there exists a finite sequence of applications of \(R\) to \(A\) that produces \(P\):

\[
P = f(A, R)
\]

## Theorem

In any consistent knowledge system \(K\), there exists at least one axiom \(A_j \in A\) that cannot be derived from the other axioms \(A \setminus \{A_j\}\) using \(R\).

## Proof

Suppose, for contradiction, that all axioms are derivable from the others:

\[
\forall A_j \in A, \quad A_j = f(A \setminus \{A_j\}, R)
\]

Then we could pick any \(A_j\) and derive it from the others. This implies that no axiom is truly fundamental, and all are dependent on other axioms.

Since \(A\) is finite, this dependency is cyclical:

\[
A_1 \text{ depends on } A_2, \quad
A_2 \text{ depends on } A_3, \quad
\dots, \quad
A_m \text{ depends on } A_1
\]

A cyclical chain of derivations provides no ultimate foundation, and in formal logic this leads either to contradiction or a trivial system where everything is derivable.

Therefore, our initial assumption is false.

\[
\implies \exists A_j \in A \text{ such that } A_j \text{ is not derivable from } A \setminus \{A_j\}
\]

## Conclusion

Every consistent knowledge system requires at least one undemonstrable axiom, which serves as the ultimate foundation of the system.
