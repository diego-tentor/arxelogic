## Abstract

We present a formal derivation of the quantization-continuity duality observed in fundamental physics, based on the ArXe Axiom which establishes an isomorphism between the logical operation of negation and Planck time. Through exentational recursion, an exponential structure T^k (k ∈ ℤ) is generated that exhibits dual properties: positive exponents generate continuous differentiable substrates (corresponding to General Relativity structure), while negative exponents act as operators whose discrete action generates quantization (corresponding to Quantum Mechanics). We rigorously demonstrate that this structure is internally consistent and compatible with standard physical dimensional analysis.

## PART I: FOUNDATIONS

### 1. Introduction and Motivation

Fundamental physics of the 20th century developed two extraordinarily successful but apparently incompatible theories:

- **General Relativity (GR):** Describes spacetime as a C^∞ differentiable manifold, gravitation as curvature, essentially continuous structure
- **Quantum Mechanics (QM):** Describes observables as operators with discrete spectra, quantization of energy/momentum/action, fundamentally discrete structure

This duality generates the central problem of contemporary theoretical physics: why does nature simultaneously exhibit continuity (GR) and discreteness (QM)?

Standard approaches to unifying GR-QM (string theory, loop quantum gravity, etc.) attempt to "quantize" gravity or "geometrize" quantum mechanics. The present work adopts a radically different strategy: **both structures emerge as dual projections of a more fundamental logical-physical principle**.

### 2. The ArXe Axiom

**Axiom 1 (ArXe Axiom):** There exists a structural isomorphism among three elements:

```
¬() ≅ Tf ≅ Tp
```

Where:
- **¬():** The operation of logical negation as the fundamental unit of logical structure
- **Tf:** A fundamental theoretical time (Fundamental Time)
- **Tp:** Planck time, defined as tp = √(ℏG/c⁵) ≈ 5.391 × 10⁻⁴⁴ s

**Conceptual justification:** While the ArXe Axiom cannot be demonstrated within the system itself, it is not entirely unfounded but arises from an intuitive insight: it emerges from recognizing that negation is fundamental to logic, that time is fundamental to physics, and that unity binds both together. This can be colloquially expressed as "tying logic and physics together at their fundamental endpoints and then following the structure that unfolds from this binding."

This axiom establishes a correspondence between the most fundamental elements of two domains: the minimal logical unit (negation) and the minimal physical temporal unit (Planck time). It does not assert reduction of one to the other, but rather **structural kinship** at their respective fundamental levels.

**Epistemic status:** This is an axiom in the strict sense: it is not demonstrated from more basic principles, but stipulated as a starting point. Its validity is evaluated by the coherence and explanatory power of the system it generates.

**Note on the "contradictory act":** The complete ArXe system emerges from a logical singularity (¬S ∧ S) that can be conceived as analogous to physical singularities: a limit-point where standard structure collapses, generating from this "fundamental discontinuity" the entire subsequent hierarchy. This singularity is not "true" in the classical ontological sense, but **generative**: the formal origin from which the structure unfolds.

### 3. Exentational Recursion System

We define recursive operations that generate an infinite logical hierarchy:

**Definition 1 (Entification):** For n ∈ ℕ, n ≥ 2:
```
Entₙ := Entₙ₋₁ ∧ ExEntₙ₋₁
```

**Definition 2 (Exentation):** For n ∈ ℕ, n ≥ 2:
```
ExEntₙ := ¬(Entₙ₋₁ ∧ ExEntₙ₋₁) ≡ ¬Entₙ₋₁ ∨ ¬ExEntₙ₋₁
```

**Initial conditions:**
```
Ent₁ := S ∧ ¬S
ExEnt₁ := S ∨ ¬S
```

Where S is an arbitrary proposition (the structure is independent of specific S).

**Interpretation:** Each level n generates two complementary elements through conjunction (Ent) and its dual negation-disjunction (ExEnt). This recursion produces an infinite self-similar hierarchy.

### 4. Mapping Function to Exponents

**Definition 3 (Function e):** We define e: ℕ → ℤ as:

```
e(n) = {
  0                    if n = 1
  (-1)ⁿ · ⌊n/2⌋        if n > 1
}
```

**Proposition 1 (Generated Sequence):** Function e generates the sequence:

| n | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | ... |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|
| e(n) | 0 | 1 | -1 | 2 | -2 | 3 | -3 | 4 | -4 | 5 | ... |

**Proof:**
- e(1) = 0 by definition
- For n = 2m (even): e(2m) = (-1)^(2m) · m = m > 0
- For n = 2m+1 (odd): e(2m+1) = (-1)^(2m+1) · m = -m < 0
- The sequence alternates: positive (n even), negative (n odd), with increasing magnitudes
∎

**Lemma 1 (Surjectivity):** Function e is surjective: ∀k ∈ ℤ, ∃n ∈ ℕ such that e(n) = k.

**Proof:**
- For k = 0: n = 1 satisfies e(1) = 0
- For k > 0: Let n = 2k (even). Then e(2k) = (-1)^(2k) · k = k
- For k < 0: Let n = -2k + 1 (odd). Then e(-2k+1) = (-1)^(-2k+1) · (-k) = k
∎

**Definition 4 (Inverse Function):** To construct the inverse, we define n: ℤ → ℕ:

```
n(k) = {
  1           if k = 0
  2k          if k > 0
  -2k + 1     if k < 0
}
```

**Proposition 2 (Bijection):** Functions e and n establish a bijection between ℕ and ℤ:
- e ∘ n = id_ℤ
- n ∘ e = id_ℕ

**Proof:** Direct verification in all three cases (k=0, k>0, k<0). ∎

### 5. Exponential Structure T^k

**Axiom 2 (Exponential Isomorphism):** The logical hierarchy {ExEntₙ : n ∈ ℕ} is isomorphic to an exponential structure {T^k : k ∈ ℤ} via:

```
ExEntₙ ↔ T^(e(n))
```

Where T is a fundamental entity whose physical nature is specified through subsequent dimensional assignment.

**Definition 5 (Exponent Group):** The set {T^k : k ∈ ℤ} under multiplication forms an abelian group isomorphic to (ℤ, +):

```
T^k · T^m = T^(k+m)
(T^k)⁻¹ = T^(-k)
T^0 = identity (dimensionless element)
```

**Proposition 3 (Dual Structure):** The exponential structure exhibits fundamental duality:
- **Positive exponents** (k > 0, n even): Substrates, direct elements
- **Negative exponents** (k < 0, n odd): Operators, inverse elements

This algebraic duality will be the formal basis of the physical continuity-quantization duality.

## PART II: CENTRAL THEOREMS

### 6. Complete Generation Theorem

**Theorem 1 (Completeness of Exponents):** Exentational recursion generates all integer exponents:

```
∀k ∈ ℤ, ∃!n ∈ ℕ : e(n) = k
```

**Proof:**

(Existence) Already demonstrated in Lemma 1.

(Uniqueness) Suppose e(n₁) = e(n₂) = k for n₁ ≠ n₂.

Case 1: k = 0
By definition, e(n) = 0 ⟺ n = 1. Therefore n₁ = n₂ = 1. Contradiction.

Case 2: k > 0
e(n) = k > 0 ⟺ n even and n = 2k. Unique solution.

Case 3: k < 0
e(n) = k < 0 ⟺ n odd and n = -2k + 1. Unique solution.

∎

**Corollary 1.1:** The ArXe hierarchy is complete: it contains representation of all integer exponents without omissions or duplications.

### 7. Discretization Theorem

Before stating the theorem, we establish the conceptual framework:

**Definition 6 (Tp Topologically Discrete):** We say Tp is discrete in the topological sense if the fundamental temporal space (T¹) has discrete topology at Planck scale: there exists no continuous structure between events separated by tp.

Formally: The set {n · tp : n ∈ ℤ} forms a discrete lattice in the fundamental time line.

**Theorem 2 (Emergence of Quantization):** If Tp is topologically discrete, then the action of operators T^(-n) on substrates T^n generates observable quantization at sufficiently small scales.

**Proof (Conceptual Scheme with Formalization):**

**Step 1 - Logical Discretization:**
The operation ¬() is inherently discrete: recursion advances by jumps n → n+1 without intermediate values. There exists no n = 2.5 nor any "fractional" level between integer levels.

**Step 2 - Transfer via Isomorphism:**
By ArXe Axiom, ¬() ≅ Tp. Logical discretization transfers to physical temporal structure: Tp inherits the discreteness of ¬().

**Step 3 - Operator Structure:**
Negative exponents T^(-n) represent variation operators:
- T^(-1) ~ d/dt (temporal variation, dimension [T⁻¹] = frequency)
- T^(-2) ~ ∇², d²/dx² (spatial variation, dimension [L⁻²] = curvature)
- T^(-3) ~ d/dm (mass variation, dimension [M⁻¹])

**Step 4 - Discrete Action:**
When an operator T^(-n) acts on a substrate T^n:

```
Observable = ∫ [Continuous Substrate T^n] · [Discrete Operator T^(-n)]
```

At Planck scale (where Tp discretization is manifest), this action produces quantized results.

**Step 5 - Physical Manifestation:**

**Energy:**
```
E = ∫ temporal_field(T¹) × frequency_operator(T^(-1))
  ≈ ℏω at Planck scale (quantized)
```

**Momentum:**
```
p = ∫ spatial_field(T²) × gradient_operator(T^(-2))  
  ≈ ℏk at quantum scale (quantized)
```

**Action:**
Dimensionally [Action] = [E][T] = [M][L²][T⁻¹] = T³·T²·T⁻¹

Minimal discretization is:
```
S_min ~ E_characteristic · tp = ℏ
```

**Conclusion:** Planck's constant ℏ emerges as the natural scale of Tp discretization, manifesting in quantization of physical observables.

∎

**Corollary 2.1 (Uncertainty Relations):** Tp discretization implies fundamental limits on simultaneous measurements:

```
ΔE · Δt ≥ ℏ/2
Δp · Δx ≥ ℏ/2
```

**Justification:** Energy cannot be measured with precision better than ℏ/Δt if time has minimal quantization Δt ~ tp.

### 8. Differentiability Theorem

**Definition 7 (Temporal Substrate):** T¹ (level n=2, k=1) is interpreted as the homogeneous temporal substrate: "ideal" time without internal structure, prior to any observation of variation.

**Theorem 3 (Necessary Differentiability):** The existence of T^(-1) in the ArXe hierarchy necessarily implies that T¹ must admit differentiable structure of class C¹.

**Proof:**

**Step 1 - Interpretation of T^(-1):**
T^(-1) has physical dimension [T⁻¹] = s⁻¹ = Hz (frequency). It represents "temporal variation" or "temporal differentiation operator".

**Step 2 - Definition of Variation:**
For T^(-1) to act as a variation operator on functions f: T¹ → ℝ, it must be able to calculate:

```
T^(-1)[f] = df/dt = lim[Δt→0] [f(t+Δt) - f(t)] / Δt
```

**Step 3 - Differentiability Requirement:**
The definition of derivative requires:
1. That domain T¹ admits topological structure (to define limits)
2. That f be differentiable on T¹
3. That the limit exists and is unique

Therefore, **T¹ must have differentiable manifold structure** (at least C¹).

**Step 4 - Non-Circularity:**
We are not assuming T¹ is differentiable and then deriving T^(-1). The argument goes in the opposite direction: the *existence* of T^(-1) in the ArXe hierarchy (which follows from exentational recursion) **forces** T¹ to be differentiable for the system to be consistent.

∎

**Theorem 4 (Infinite Differentiability):** The infinite recursion of ArXe that generates T^(-n) for all n ∈ ℕ implies that T¹ must be infinitely differentiable (class C^∞).

**Proof:**

**Step 1 - Generation of All T^(-n):**
By Theorem 1, recursion generates:
- T^(-1) (level n=3)
- T^(-2) (level n=5)
- T^(-3) (level n=7)
- ...
- T^(-n) for all n ∈ ℕ

**Step 2 - Higher Order Interpretation:**
Successive negative exponents can be interpreted as differential operators of increasing order:

| T^(-n) | Dimensional Interpretation | Associated Operator |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| T^(-1) | [T⁻¹] | d/dt |
| T^(-2) | [L⁻²] or [T⁻²] | d²/dx² or d²/dt² |
| T^(-3) | [M⁻¹] or [T⁻³] | d/dm or d³/dt³ |

**Step 3 - Existence of All-Order Derivatives:**
If all T^(-n) exist and act as differential operators, then for functions f: T¹ → ℝ derivatives of all orders must exist:

```
d^n f / dt^n exists and is well-defined ∀n ∈ ℕ
```

**Step 4 - Definition of C^∞:**
A function is of class C^∞ if and only if it admits continuous derivatives of all orders. Therefore, T¹ must be a differentiable manifold of class C^∞.

∎

**Corollary 4.1 (Spacetime Structure):** By analogous arguments, T² (space) must also be C^∞. Therefore, spacetime (T¹ ⊗ T²) is a differentiable manifold of class C^∞.

**Physical Implication:** This is precisely the mathematical structure assumed by General Relativity. ArXe derives this structure from logical-recursive considerations, not as an additional physical postulate.

### 9. Dimensional Compatibility Theorem

**Definition 8 (Dimensional Assignment):** We establish correspondence with fundamental physical dimensions:

```
T¹ ≡ T  (Time)
T² ≡ L  (Length)
T³ ≡ M  (Mass)
```

**Theorem 5 (Dimensional Consistency):** The dimensional assignment T¹≡T, T²≡L, T³≡M is consistent with standard physical dimensional analysis.

**Proof:**

**Step 1 - Group Structure:**
In dimensional analysis, dimensions form a free abelian group under multiplication:
```
[Physical Quantity] = M^a · L^b · T^c
```

**Step 2 - Isomorphism with ArXe:**
The structure {T^k} also forms an abelian group. The assignment:
```
T³ → M
T² → L  
T¹ → T
```

preserves group structure:
```
(T³)^a · (T²)^b · (T¹)^c = T^(3a+2b+c)
```

**Step 3 - Verification with Physical Quantities:**

| Quantity | Standard Dimension | ArXe Expression | Verification |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Velocity | L·T⁻¹ | T²·T⁻¹ | ✓ |
| Acceleration | L·T⁻² | T²·T⁻¹·T⁻¹ | ✓ |
| Force | M·L·T⁻² | T³·T²·T⁻¹·T⁻¹ | ✓ |
| Energy | M·L²·T⁻² | T³·T²·T²·T⁻¹·T⁻¹ | ✓ |
| Action | M·L²·T⁻¹ | T³·T²·T²·T⁻¹ | ✓ |

All known physical dimensions are representable.

∎

**Corollary 5.1 (Dimensional Completeness):** Every measurable physical quantity in the MLT system is expressible in ArXe structure.

## PART III: PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION

### 10. Correspondence with General Relativity

**Proposition 4 (GR Structure from ArXe):** The mathematical structure of General Relativity emerges naturally from the continuous projection of substrates T^n.

**Derived Elements:**

**(A) Differentiable Manifold:**
By Theorems 3-4, T¹ and T² are C^∞ → Spacetime is a differentiable manifold M of class C^∞.

**(B) Metric Tensor:**
To measure "distances" between events in M (involving T¹ and T²), a symmetric bilinear form is required:

```
ds² = g_μν dx^μ dx^ν
```

where g_μν is the metric tensor.

**(C) Curvature:**
T^(-2) (level n=5) represents spatial variation. Its action on T² generates inhomogeneities → space curvature.

Dimensionally: [Curvature] = L⁻² = [T^(-2)]

**(D) Field Equations:**
T³ represents mass/energy. The influence of T³ on curvature (T^(-2)) generates Einstein's equations:

```
R_μν - (1/2)g_μν R = (8πG/c⁴) T_μν
```

**ArXe Interpretation:**
- Left side: Geometry (curvature ~ T^(-2))
- Right side: Matter-energy (T³ and its variations T^(-1), T^(-2))

**Conclusion:** GR emerges as the theory of continuous substrates T^n acting in differentiable regime.

### 11. Correspondence with Quantum Mechanics

**Proposition 5 (QM Structure from ArXe):** The mathematical structure of Quantum Mechanics emerges from the discrete projection of Tp and the action of operators T^(-n).

**Derived Elements:**

**(A) Hilbert Space:**
If Tp is discrete, the state space cannot be classical-continuous. An abstract space where transitions are discontinuous is required → Hilbert space ℋ.

**(B) Hermitian Operators:**
Physical quantities are operators with potentially discrete spectrum:

```
Â|ψ⟩ = a|ψ⟩
```

Eigenvalues {a} represent measurable values (possibly discrete).

**(C) Planck's Constant:**
By Theorem 2, the minimal discretization of action is:

```
S_min = ℏ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s
```

**(D) Schrödinger Equation:**
Temporal evolution in discrete time generates:

```
iℏ ∂|ψ⟩/∂t = Ĥ|ψ⟩
```

Where:
- ℏ = discretization scale of Tp
- Ĥ = Hamiltonian operator (generator of temporal evolution)
- i = imaginary unit (guarantees unitarity)

**(E) Uncertainty Relations:**
By Corollary 2.1:

```
ΔE·Δt ≥ ℏ/2
Δp·Δx ≥ ℏ/2
```

**Conclusion:** QM emerges as the theory of discrete operators T^(-n) acting on substrates in quantum regime.

### 12. Unobservable Binary Structures

**Definition 9 (Binary Structure):** A physical system is binary in the ArXe sense if it involves exactly two relational elements without admitting a third element (observer).

**Proposition 6 (Unobservability of Binary Structures):** Fundamental binary structures are inherently unobservable directly.

**Justification:**

**(A) Observer Emergence:**
A physical (non-metaphysical) observer emerges at T³ or higher levels, requiring minimal ternary structure (past-present-future, or equivalently: observer-observed-relation).

**(B) Structural Exclusion:**
T¹ and T^(-1) are binary-level structures (n=2, n=3). They do not admit a third constitutive element → Do not admit observer → Unobservable directly.

**(C) Indirect Observability:**
Although unobservable directly, these structures are **causally efficacious**: they produce observable effects at T³+.

**Physical Examples:**

**(1) Virtual Particles:**
- Creation-annihilation pairs (binary structure)
- Not directly observable
- Observable effects: Lamb shift, magnetic anomalies, Casimir force

**(2) Planck Pairs:**
- Fundamental T¹ structures
- Unobservable (pre-empirical)
- Effects: quantization observable at small scales

**(3) Pre-Collapse Interactions:**
- Quantum states before decoherence
- Binary relation (system-environment without observer)
- Only traces after collapse are observable

**ArXe Prediction:** Every physical structure identified as fundamentally binary should be unobservable directly but causally efficacious. This is a testable structural prediction.

## PART IV: CRITICAL EVALUATION

### 13. Scope of Demonstrations

**What has been rigorously demonstrated:**

✓ **Formal consistency:** ArXe recursion generates internally coherent mathematical structure (Theorems 1-5)

✓ **Exponential completeness:** All integer exponents are generated without omissions (Theorem 1)

✓ **Necessity of differentiability:** If T^(-n) exist, then T^n must be C^∞ (Theorems 3-4)

✓ **Dimensional compatibility:** ArXe reproduces standard MLT dimensional analysis (Theorem 5)

✓ **Structural duality:** Positive/negative exponents exhibit systematic dual properties

**What has not been demonstrated (requires additional work):**

✗ **Truth of ArXe Axiom:** ¬() ≅ Tp is axiomatic stipulation, not demonstration

✗ **Physical discretization of Tp:** Logical discretization of ¬() transfers to Tp by axiom, not by demonstrated physical necessity

✗ **Numerical values:** Physical constants (G, ℏ, c, particle masses) are not derived

✗ **Detailed causal mechanism:** The "how" of emergence T¹ → T³ is not mathematically formalized

✗ **New quantitative predictions:** Only reinterpretation of known phenomena, without independent empirical predictions

### 14. Limitations and Open Problems

**(A) Nature of the Axiom:**
The ArXe Axiom establishes ¬() ≅ Tp without independent justification. Why this specific correspondence and not another?

**Open problem:** Does an argument exist showing this correspondence is unique, natural, or preferable to alternatives?

**(B) Discrete-Continuous Transition:**
The system affirms Tp is discrete but T^n (n>0) are continuous. The precise mechanism of this transition requires formalization.

**Open problem:** How to mathematically formalize the "dilution" of discreteness when passing from Tp to T³+?

**(C) Physical Observer:**
It is claimed the observer emerges at T³, but how ternary structure generates observational capacity is not formalized.

**Open problem:** What specific mathematical properties of T³ permit emergence of observation?

**(D) Numerical Values:**
ArXe does not derive why ℏ has its specific value, nor particle masses, nor other dimensionless constants (α, mass ratios, etc.).

**Open problem:** Is there a way to derive dimensionless ratios from structure e(n)?

**(E) GR-QM Incompatibility:**
ArXe explains why both structures coexist, but does not resolve their incompatibility at Planck scale (quantum gravity).

**Open problem:** Does ArXe suggest a specific route toward quantum gravity?

### 15. Comparison with Standard Interpretations

**Comparative Table:**

| Aspect | Standard Interpretation | ArXe Interpretation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Origin of quantization** | Phenomenological postulate (ℏ as fundamental constant) | Emerges from topologically discrete Tp |
| **Origin of continuity** | Geometric postulate (differentiable manifold) | Emerges from existence of T^(-n) |
| **GR-QM relation** | Incompatible theories requiring unification | Dual projections of single structure |
| **Spacetime** | Fundamental continuum | Continuous substrate (T^n) with underlying discrete time (Tp) |
| **Virtual particles** | Quantum vacuum fluctuations | Unobservable binary structures |
| **Constant ℏ** | Fundamental without derivation | Discretization scale of Tp |
| **Observer** | Problematic in QM (collapse) | Emerges at T³ (ternary structure) |
| **Physical dimensions** | Independent (T, L, M arbitrary) | Recursive hierarchy (T¹, T², T³) |

**Evaluation:**

*ArXe strength:* Offers unified conceptual framework explaining why continuity and discreteness coexist

*ArXe weakness:* Does not generate new empirical predictions allowing decision between interpretations

### 16. Directions for Future Research

The following research lines could strengthen or refute the ArXe framework:

**(A) Quantitative Derivation of Constants**

**Objective:** Find relations of the type:
```
Dimensionless_constant = f(e(n), ArXe_structure)
```

**Concrete examples:**
- Does fine structure constant α ≈ 1/137 relate to some combination of levels n?
- Do mass ratios m_e/m_μ, m_p/m_e have derivable algebraic structure?
- Does the number of fermion families (3) relate to T³?

**(B) Formalization of Emergence Mechanism**

**Objective:** Develop precise mathematics of transition between levels:
```
T¹ ⊗ T¹ → T² (how formally?)
T² ⊗ T¹ → T³ (specific operation?)
```

**Possible tools:**
- Category theory (functors between levels)
- Operator algebras (C*-algebras)
- Sheaf theory over level hierarchy

**(C) Prediction of Binary Structures**

**Objective:** Generate exhaustive list of structures ArXe predicts are binary (unobservable directly):

1. Tp itself (fundamental T¹)
2. Operators T^(-1), T^(-2), T^(-3) acting in isolation
3. Weak interactions before symmetry breaking?
4. Pre-inflationary universe states?
5. Structures inside event horizons?

**Test:** Verify if list coincides exactly with phenomena known as unobservable directly

**(D) Extension to Higher Dimensions**

**Objective:** Explore levels T⁴, T⁵, T⁶...

**Questions:**
- Does T⁴ correspond to observable physical structure? (Extra dimensions from string theory?)
- Do T⁵ and higher have physical manifestation or are purely formal?
- Is there natural limit to hierarchy or is it infinite?

**(E) Connection with Quantum Entanglement**

**Objective:** Formalize how ArXe binary structures generate entanglement

**Hypothesis:** Two entangled particles form binary structure excluding local observer → non-locality emerges naturally

**Test:** Does ArXe predict specific Bell inequality violations distinct from standard QM predictions?

**(F) Quantum Gravity from ArXe**

**Objective:** Use substrate-operator duality to address GR-QM incompatibility

**Strategy:** If T^n are continuous and T^(-n) discrete, does an "intermediate" regime exist where both aspects are simultaneously manifest?

**Critical scale:** Planck length/time/energy (where Tp discreteness should be observable)

## TECHNICAL APPENDICES

### Appendix A: Auxiliary Demonstrations

**Lemma A.1 (Parity of e(n)):**
For n > 1:
- e(n) > 0 ⟺ n ≡ 0 (mod 2)
- e(n) < 0 ⟺ n ≡ 1 (mod 2)

**Proof:**
e(n) = (-1)^n · ⌊n/2⌋

If n = 2k (even): e(2k) = (-1)^(2k) · k = (+1) · k = k > 0
If n = 2k+1 (odd): e(2k+1) = (-1)^(2k+1) · k = (-1) · k = -k < 0
∎

**Lemma A.2 (Monotonicity of |e(n)|):**
For n > 1: |e(n+2)| = |e(n)| + 1

**Proof:**
Case n even: n = 2k
- |e(2k)| = k
- |e(2k+2)| = |e(2(k+1))| = k+1 = |e(2k)| + 1 ✓

Case n odd: n = 2k+1
- |e(2k+1)| = k
- |e(2k+3)| = |e(2(k+1)+1)| = k+1 = |e(2k+1)| + 1 ✓
∎

**Proposition A.3 (Density in ℤ):**
The image of e is exactly ℤ: Im(e) = ℤ

**Proof:**
Already demonstrated in Lemma 1 (surjectivity). Here we add that there are no "jumps":

For each k ∈ ℤ, there exists exactly one n with e(n) = k (by uniqueness from Theorem 1), and the levels interleave in absolute value.

### Appendix C: Extended Dimensional Analysis

**Table C.1: Mechanical Quantities**

| Quantity | Standard Dim. | ArXe | Minimum Level |
|----------|---------------|------|---------------|
| Position | L | T² | n=4 |
| Time | T | T¹ | n=2 |
| Velocity | LT⁻¹ | T²T⁻¹ | n=4 (uses T⁻¹ from n=3) |
| Acceleration | LT⁻² | T²T⁻²=(T²)(T⁻¹)² | n=4 |
| Mass | M | T³ | n=6 |
| Momentum | MLT⁻¹ | T³T²T⁻¹ | n=6 |
| Force | MLT⁻² | T³T²T⁻² | n=6 |
| Energy | ML²T⁻² | T³(T²)²T⁻² | n=6 |
| Power | ML²T⁻³ | T³(T²)²T⁻³ | n=6 |
| Action | ML²T⁻¹ | T³(T²)²T⁻¹ | n=6 |
| Density | ML⁻³ | T³(T²)⁻³=T³T⁻⁶ | n=13 (T⁻⁶) |

**Observation:** All observable quantities require level n≥6 (T³), consistent with observer emergence in ternary structure.

**Table C.2: Fundamental Constants**

| Constant | Value | Dimension | ArXe | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|-----------|------|----------------|
| c | 2.998×10⁸ m/s | LT⁻¹ | T²T⁻¹ | Space/time ratio |
| G | 6.674×10⁻¹¹ m³kg⁻¹s⁻² | L³M⁻¹T⁻² | (T²)³T⁻³T⁻² | Gravitational coupling |
| ℏ | 1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s | ML²T⁻¹ | T³(T²)²T⁻¹ | Tp scale |
| t_P | 5.391×10⁻⁴⁴ s | T | T¹ | Fundamental time |
| ℓ_P | 1.616×10⁻³⁵ m | L | T² | Fundamental length |
| m_P | 2.176×10⁻⁸ kg | M | T³ | Fundamental mass |

**Planck Relations:**
```
t_P = ℓ_P / c = √(ℏG/c⁵)
```

In ArXe:
```
T¹ = T² / (T²T⁻¹) = T² · T · T⁻² = T¹  ✓
```

Dimensionally consistent.

### Appendix D: Comparison with Other Approaches

**Table D.1: Approaches to GR-QM Unification**

| Approach | Strategy | Status | Relation to ArXe |
|----------|----------|--------|------------------|
| **String Theory** | Quantize gravitation | Mathematically rich, not testable | Complementary (could live in T⁴+) |
| **Loop Quantum Gravity** | Geometrize QM | Discrete spacetime | Similar intuition (fundamental discreteness) |
| **Non-Commutative Geometry** | Algebra instead of geometry | Formal | Similar (fundamental algebraic structure) |
| **Twistor Theory** | Reformulate spacetime | Geometric | Different approach |
| **Causal Sets** | Spacetime as partially ordered set | Causal discretization | Very similar (discretization + causality) |
| **ArXe** | Logical recursion → physical duality | Interpretative | Unifying conceptual framework |

**Observation:** ArXe does not compete with these approaches at the mathematical-technical level, but offers an interpretative framework for **why** discrete and continuous approaches coexist.

## CONCLUSIONS

### Summary of Demonstrated Results

We have rigorously established:

1. **Minimal Axiomatization:** A single axiom (¬() ≅ Tp) plus logical recursion generates entire structure

2. **Mathematical Theorems:**
   - Completeness: all k ∈ ℤ are generated (Theorem 1)
   - Discretization: discrete Tp implies quantization (Theorem 2)
   - Differentiability: T^(-n) implies T^n is C^∞ (Theorems 3-4)
   - Compatibility: ArXe reproduces MLT (Theorem 5)

3. **Physical Correspondences:**
   - GR emerges from continuous projection (substrates T^n)
   - QM emerges from discrete projection (operators T^(-n))
   - GR-QM duality as manifestation of algebraic duality k ↔ -k

4. **Structural Prediction:** Binary structures are unobservable directly (testable through comparison with known phenomena)

### Nature of the Work

This document presents:

- **Rigorous mathematics:** Precise definitions, theorems with proofs
- **Physical interpretation:** Correspondence with known structures (GR/QM)
- **Conceptual framework:** Unified explanation of quantization-continuity duality

**Does not present:**
- Ab initio derivation of physical constants
- New quantitative empirical predictions
- Demonstration that the axiom is true of the universe

### Epistemic Status

ArXe is an **interpretative theory with explicit axiomatization**:

- Assumes axiom ¬() ≅ Tp without external demonstration
- Derives rigorous formal consequences
- Offers reinterpretation of known physics
- Compatible with but not derivable from empirical physics

**Analogy:** Similar to how Riemannian geometry is a coherent formal system that **happens to** describe spacetime (GR), but does not "demonstrate" the universe is curved.

### Scientific-Philosophical Value

**Contributions:**

1. **Unifying conceptual framework** for understanding continuity-discreteness coexistence
2. **Formal derivation** of necessity of differentiability from operator existence
3. **Explanation** of unobservability of fundamental structures (not arbitrary but structural)
4. **Connection** between formal logic and physical structure

**Recognized Limitations:**

1. Axiom stipulated, not demonstrated
2. No quantitative predictions
3. Detailed causal mechanisms pending formalization
4. Does not resolve technical problems of quantum gravity

### Future Work

Most promising directions to develop ArXe:

1. **Quantitative derivation:** Seek relations between dimensionless constants and structure e(n)
2. **Categorical formalization:** Use category theory to formalize transitions between levels
3. **Empirical test:** Verify list of binary structures against known unobservable phenomena
4. **Extension to higher levels:** Explore T⁴, T⁵... and their possible physical manifestations

## FINAL NOTES FOR THE READER

This document presents a speculative theoretical proposal with strong mathematical formalization. The reader should keep in mind:

1. **The ArXe Axiom is stipulative:** There is no independent proof that ¬() ≅ Tp is true of the physical universe.

2. **Demonstrations are conditional:** "If the axiom is accepted, then these consequences follow" (logically valid), not "Therefore, the universe is thus" (would require additional empirical evidence).

3. **Interpretative value:** Even if ArXe is not literally true, it offers a useful conceptual framework for thinking about fundamental physical duality.

4. **Openness to refutation:** The framework is sufficiently precise to be criticized and potentially refuted by future theoretical or empirical development.

The spirit of this work is to offer a **rigorous conceptual tool** for exploring one of the deepest problems in fundamental physics, honestly recognizing both its strengths and limitations.
